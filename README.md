# Number Guessing Challenge Game

This is a simple web-based number guessing game built with Streamlit. The game generates a random number between 1 and 100, and the player has to guess it in as few attempts as possible. After each guess, the game provides feedback whether the guess is too high or too low, and the player can keep guessing until they find the correct number.
